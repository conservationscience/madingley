# madingley

#### Overview
The code in this repository matches a list of species with functional groups from the output of the Madingley model.

#### Todo
- Need to get the code to work directly on the outputs of the Madingley model
- Need to put the code into a function or a class, and somehow have it save it's progress as it collects trait information and extracts information, so if the computer crashes, it doesn't have to start from the complete beginning
